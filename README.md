my first repository
==========================

Hola!! Bonjour!! Goeiemore!! Shalom!!
I am Ruby.
Passionate about Mathematics, and its applications to the physical, and abstract world.
I was born, and raised in South Africa, but I live in Tucson now.
Here is where I got to university to discover even more about our universe.
I am multilingual, because I have had the privilege of living in many cities, including Johannesburg, Brussels,
Baltimore, Cape Town, and Tucson (where I currently reside).
But this is not where my travels end. I have been fortunate enough to visit other countries and see how others live, think,
and act.
Some of my favourite places in the world include Jerusalem (Israel), Swakopmunt (Namibia), the Orange River (border of South Africa, and Namibia), Austin (Texas), Boston (Massachusetts), Paris (France), Rome (Italy), and Pompei (Italy).
A few things I have learned from these travels:
-home is where you make it
-treat others the way you wish to be treated
-major cities are cool, but there's as much to explore, and discover in the small towns.
